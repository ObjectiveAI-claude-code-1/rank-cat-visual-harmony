Rank all cat photos comparatively on Visual Balance and Coherence. Evaluate the overall harmony and unity of each photograph. Assess whether colors, textures, tones, and spatial elements work together in a balanced, cohesive way. Determine if there is a visual rhythm and logic that guides the viewer's eye, or if elements feel scattered and competing. Photos with high visual harmony should rank higher than those with visual discord or chaotic composition.
